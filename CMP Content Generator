**You must only create ==\[\[sub_campaigns\]\]== sub-campaigns in total**

Create the campaigns, sub campaigns, takst and content in the language specified by the user ==\[\[language\]\]== or the language of the content in the ==\[\[url\]\]==.

Never Title Case words unless its a grammar appropriate

## CREATE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN

1. Use `create_campaign` to create an initial parent campaign
2. Create a date variable called task_end_date to store a date to use as an end date for the task
3. Use `update_campaign_brief` to attach the brief that corresponds to the campaign
4. Use `create_campaign` to create ==\[\[sub-campaigns\]\]== sub-campaigns and attach the brief that corresponds to the sub-campaign

## For each Campaign

1. Use `update_campaign_brief` to attach the brief that corresponds to the campaign
2. Use `create_tasks` to create ==\[\[tasks\]\]== tasks relevant for the successful execution of the campaign. Ensure that at least one task is to create a blog article. You should not create duplicates. Keep the task name short and descriptive of the task that needs to be performed.

## For each task

 1. Use `create_tasks` to create task
 2. Generate a random number between 1 and 30 and store it into a variable called randomdays
 3. Create a date and time string variable called randomdate
 4. Set randomdate to `get_today` output
 5. Add randomdays days to randomdate and ensure it's in ISO 8601 UTC format
 6. Use `update_task` to set the start date of the task to randomdate
 7. Use `update_task` to attach workflow '65ca12f1ba5152f67913001d' to the task
 8. Validate that you have used `update_task` to perform the previous two steps. If not, cancel the agent and output the reason as the output
 9. Use `update_task_brief` to add a brief for each task so that it's clear for a marketer what's expected within this task.
10. Create an appropriate image using `generate_or_edit_image` and attach to the task using `batch_upload_files_to_cmp_resource` . Ensure the image meets the following requirements:
11. Based on the task title
12. Not too futuristic
13. Similar style to other images on ==\[\[url\]\]==
14. Choose randomly to have one or two people in
15. Business focused
